					<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As a member of the <a href="http://www.psychofdesign.com/">Psychology of Design Laboratory</a> at Old Dominion University, my master's thesis work is concerned with usable cybersecurity. One of the greatest weaknesses of text-based passwords is the increasing list of demands to make them stronger: longer character minimums, requirements for special characters and numbers, etc. While such passwords may be more resistant to brute-force attacks, they are also more resistant to the user's memory. Of course, many users find workarounds by using the same "strong" password across multiple accounts. However, this means that if one database is breached, that user's privacy is compromised many times over. Graphical authentication, on the other hand, uses picture-based passwords that are easier to remember than text-based passwords. In my current study, I compare both methods of authentication on user-reported satisfaction. I also explore the impact of a newly assigned text- and picture-based password/passcode on working memory recall to inform usability in applied settings.</p>

					<h3>Usability</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Last fall, I took on a leadership role to develop a literature review of usability across several domains, including cybersecurity, transportation, telehealth, and aging and autistic populations. For each topic, I received an independent literature review from a fellow peer in Human-Computer Interaction. Using the findings from all six reviews, I authored an overview of the value, adoption, and measurement of usability. I also guided my classmates through the optimal literature review process and provided guidance throughout the semester to ensure that our research remained coherent. Our manuscript has been accepted by the Journal of Human Factors, and we look forward to seeing our publication in the upcoming special issue!</p>

					<h3>Virtual Reality</h3>
				</header>
				<p>During my first year in the program, I led a follow-on virtual reality study originally funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. After teaching participants how to navigate and interact with the virtual environment, they completed a simple shopping game in an outdoor marketplace. Throughout this task, participants were approached by robotic agents who asked them to surrender a non-lethal weapon. My primary interest in this study was how participants’ compliance might be affected by robotic the peacekeepers’ level of anthropomorphism. Additionally, I was interested in possible effects of the virtual environment on simulator sickness among Chinese or Japanese participants, as Asian populations are known to be especially susceptible. Although data collection ended with the retirement of my research adviser on this project, I greatly enjoyed running a VR study of my own. In the past, I have also assisted with research at Promena VR, a virtual reality-based therapy center in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Along with the company founder and CEO of Promena, I wrote a book chapter on virtual reality-based behavioral interventions for special populations.</p>
