<p>As a PhD student in <a href="https://www.odu.edu/psychology/academics/human-factors">human factors</a> and a member of the <a href="http://www.psychofdesign.com/">Psychology of Design Lab</a> at Old Dominion University, my interest in human-computer interaction has led to first authorship of a literature review on usability across several domains (currently in press with the Journal of Human Factors). My current research in cybersecurity seeks to explore the usability and working memory performance of different authentication methods. In my spare time, I serve as webmaster (webmistress?) and PR manager of the <a href="https://www.oduhfes.com/">student HFES chapter at ODU</a>.</p>

<p>I have also enjoyed data collection involving user behavior in virtual reality. During my first year, I took the lead on a follow-on project to examine user trust following human-robot interactions within a virtual environment. Previously, I have had the pleasure of working alongside Promena VR in Grand Rapids, MI to explore the various benefits of virtual reality in mental health settings.</p>
