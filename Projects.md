					<h3>Flakr</h3>
				</header>
				<p>In our increasingly digital world, flaky people have it made. It’s easier than ever to play “yes man” now and bow out later. We can <i>make</i> plans with the best of intentions...then cancel them in a matter of keystrokes. Busy people can’t seem to make plans; flaky people can’t seem to keep them. <br><br> This realization is what inspired my idea for the Flakr app. From a low-fidelity paper prototype, I ended up creating a wireframe with Adobe XD. I knew this would primarily be an event app, but with one novel twist: along with the date, time and location, users would be able to set a $1-$5 flaker’s fee for those who RSVP “yes” and end up as no-shows. Those who follow through, of course, would not be charged – but they would be entered to win the flaker’s fees, or Flakr pool.

					<h3>Use Your Illusion</h3>
				</header>
				<p>In terms of login speed, Use Your Illusion (first developed by Hayashi et al., 2008), is an especially promising scheme for graphical authentication. The user is assigned a passcode of three images, whose quality is then degraded to prevent over-the-shoulder attacks. To authenticate, the user must select his or her passcode images from a grid of distractor images, which are also degraded. However, Tiller et al. (2018) suggest  that the current level of image degradation may be too great for users to remember. Following their <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-94782-2_9">design recommendations</a>, I developed my own version of a UYI-based login using Pexels open-source images, GIMP graphics editor, and Paradigm research software.</p>

					<h3>ODU HFES Logo Design</h3>
				</header>
				<p>In my free time, I volunteer as webmaster for the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society student chapter at Old Dominion University. This year, I was also proud to win the logo redesign contest. I thought to myself that our original logo needed some more modern, eye-grabbing rework, so I came up with a variety of designs. This is the one that stuck!</p>

					<h3>Playtest: A Discrete Event Simulation</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Using a discrete event simulation tool developed by <a href="https://www.odu.edu/vmasc">VMASC</a>, I recently developed a model of a 24-hour playtest for a co-op fighting game. At first, my simulation was very basic – I only meant to see how players would progress through a short demo, one by one. Then I considered introducing different character types that would advance as a team through boss battles. From there, I fleshed out the abilities of each character type that would influence their survivability in each battle. I decided to have some fun with Greek mythology by basing each character type on nymphs and their elements: dryads (tree dwellers), nephele (cloud dwellers), naiads (water dwellers), oreads (mountain dwellers), and melinoë (night dwellers). I then created simplified survivability scores, assuming average player ability, to determine the odds of each character type to advance (e.g., a nephele might have 80% survivability against an outdoor boss, but only 50% against an underground boss). The total survivability scores for each character equal ~65%, assuming this is an average player’s first attempt. I had a blast with this process as I incorporated feedback from peers in a Modeling & Simulation course.
